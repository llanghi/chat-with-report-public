\# Chat with Report (Public Demo)



This is a lightweight demo UI for the Northern Perth Basin RAG prototype.  

It connects to a local or hosted FastAPI backend running `app.py` on WAHOO-kf (Loz' laptop) that indexes PDF reports and answers natural-language questions.



\### How to use

1\. Open the Streamlit web app.

2\. Enter a question about the report.

3\. The model will answer using only the indexed PDFs.
